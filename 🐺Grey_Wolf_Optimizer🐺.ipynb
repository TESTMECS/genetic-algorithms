        "### Overview\n",
        "- Inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves.\n",
        "- Population of grey wolves that hunt in the continuous search space.\n",
        "- A Leader wolf (alpha) that guides the pack towards promising areas.\n",
        "- Follower wolves (beta and delta) that help scout the search space.\n",
        "- Omega wolves that follow the guidance of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves.\n",
        "- A set of encircling, hunting, and attacking coefficents to balance exploration vs explotation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Uses üéØ\n",
        "- Find the optimal solution to complex optimization problems like function optimization, feature selection, scheduling etc.\n",
        "- At each iteration the alpha, beta, and delta wolves guide the omega wolves by updating their distance and position based on the best three solutions.\n",
        "- The omega wolves update their positions by encircling, hunting, and attacking the prey guided by the top three wolves.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future Research Directions ü§î\n",
        "- Hybridizing GWO with other metaheuristic algorithms to improve performance.\n",
        "- Applying GWO to solve multi-objective optimization problems.\n",
        "- Developing adaptive parameter control strategies for GWO.\n",
        "- Exploring the use of GWO in dynamic and noisy environments.\n",
