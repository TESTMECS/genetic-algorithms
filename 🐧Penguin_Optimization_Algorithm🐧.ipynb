        "\n",
        "- Population of penguins that can dive and swim in a continuous search space.\n",
        "- A prey matrix that stores the position and fitness value of each prey (potential solutions).\n",
        "- A diving model that simulates the penguins' movement towards the prey.\n",
        "- A swimming model that simulates the penguins' movement around the prey.\n",
        "- A set of parameters that control the diving depth, the swimming radius, and the number of prey.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Uses üöÄ\n",
        "\n",
        "- At each iteration, each penguin updates its position by applying either the diving model or the swimming model, depending on a random parameter.\n",
        "- Penguins move towards the swimming model in a spiral shape.\n",
        "- Also allows the penguin to move around the best solution randomly.\n",
        "- The prey are updated by better penguin solutions found during the iteration.\n",
